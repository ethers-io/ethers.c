Testing
=======

The testcases are from [https://github.com/ethers-io/](Ethers.js),
generated by scripts.

To compile and run the tests:

```
/home/ricmoo/firefly-ethers/tests> ./run-tests.sh
```


The `convert-tests.mjs` can be updated and used to convert the `.json.gz`
testcases from Ethers.js into both CBOR and header file vairants.

See the `tests.c` for examples on adding tests.
